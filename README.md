# Anomaly Detector Samples

This repository contains API samples and SDK samples for [Anomaly Detector service](https://aka.ms/anomalydetector). Anomaly Detector enables you to monitor and find abnormalities in your time series data by automatically identifying and applying the correct statistical models, regardless of industry, scenario, or data volume.

## What's new?

### March 2024: Anomaly Detector Now Available on PYPI üéâ

In March 2024, we proudly announce the release of the Anomaly Detector package on PYPI! 

While the existing Anomaly Detector as a service will be deprecated by 2026, you can now seamlessly utilize the new package directly on your local machine. No need to create an Azure Anomaly Detector resource‚Äîsimply install the package and start detecting anomalies right away.

For the latest details and usage instructions, refer to our Python notebook available here: [anomaly-detector-pypi-demo.ipynb](anomaly-detector-pypi-demo.ipynb)

## üëãAbout Anomaly Detector
[Anomaly Detector](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/anomaly-detector/overview) is an AI service with a set of APIs, which enables you to monitor and detect anomalies in your time series data with little ML knowledge, either batch validation or real-time inference.

[Univariate Anomaly Detection API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/anomaly-detector/how-to/identify-anomalies) enables you to monitor and detect abnormalities in your single variable without having to know machine learning. The Anomaly Detector API's algorithms adapt by automatically identifying and applying the best-fitting models to your data, regardless of industry, scenario, or data volume. Using your time series data, the API determines boundaries for anomaly detection, expected values, and which data points are anomalies.

[Multivariate anomaly detection API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/anomaly-detector/how-to/create-resource) further enable developers by easily integrating advanced AI for detecting anomalies from groups of metrics, without the need for machine learning knowledge or labeled data. Dependencies and inter-correlations between up to 300 different signals are now automatically counted as key factors. This new capability helps you to proactively protect your complex systems such as software applications, servers, factory machines, spacecraft, or even your business, from failures.

## Prerequisites

You must have an [Anomaly Detector API resource](https://aka.ms/adnew). Before continuing, you will need the API **key** and the **endpoint** from your Azure dashboard.

## Container demo

(Only support UVAD)

If you want to run the notebook with an on-premise UVAD version of [Anomaly Detector as container](https://aka.ms/adcontainerdocs), there're four prerequisites that must be met:

1. You have access to the Azure Container Registry which hosts the Anomaly Detector container images. Please complete and submit the [Anomaly Detector Container Request form](https://aka.ms/adcontainer) to request access to the container.
1. You have created an Anomaly Detector resource on Azure.
1. You have the proper container environment ready to host the Anomaly Detector container. Please read [Prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/anomaly-detector/anomaly-detector-container-howto#prerequisites) and [The host computer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/anomaly-detector/anomaly-detector-container-howto#the-host-computer) for details.
1. You have [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install.html) installed on your computer. We recommend installing Python and Jupyter using the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/downloads).

After you pull the container image and spin it up, ensure there's an HTTP endpoint accessible to the APIs and this will be your **endpoint** for the demo.
To run the notebook with your Anomaly Detector container instance, complete the following steps:

1. Clone this project to your local directory
1. Start **Anaconda Prompt**
1. In the command line, change the working directory to your project directory using **cd**
1. Type **jupyter notebook** and run which opens http://localhost:8888/tree in a browser window
1. Open one of the notebooks under **ipython-notebook** folder
1. Fill in the API key (from your Anomaly Detector resource on Azure) and the endpoint (from your Anomaly Detector container instance)
1. In the Notebook main menu, click Cell->run all
